# Battleship
Battleship project

This was the first big project/game I completed back at the start of 2021, roughly 9 months after enrolling in school for Computer Science. I wanted to build more stuff outside of what I was doing at school so I started developing this game while going through the project course at JetBrains Academy (https://hyperskill.org/projects/125?track=8). 

This was probably one of the most challenging things I had done so far in my journey to becoming a software engineer at the time. I struggled through this project but it taught me quite a bit. I expanded my knowledge of OOP, data structures, static and instance variables, and exceptions. I also think this was the first time I started learning and using GIT. With the little bit of experience I had at the time, the code is a little messy, but it is running 100% correctly and passed all test cases.
